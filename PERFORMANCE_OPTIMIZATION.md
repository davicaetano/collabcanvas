# Performance Optimization - AI Agent

## Problem Identified

The AI agent was taking **60+ seconds** to respond to simple commands because LangChain's AgentExecutor was making **3 consecutive API calls to OpenAI** for each command:

1. **First call**: Decide which tool to use
2. **Second call**: Execute the tool  
3. **Third call**: Generate final response

With each GPT-4o call taking 2-5 seconds, this resulted in **6-15 seconds per command** (even longer in production).

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Switch to GPT-4o-mini (canvas_agent.py)
- **Before**: `model="gpt-4o"`
- **After**: `model="gpt-4o-mini"`
- **Impact**: 2-3x faster responses, 15x cheaper
- **Quality**: Maintains excellent performance for canvas manipulation tasks

### 2. Reduce Temperature (canvas_agent.py)
- **Before**: `temperature=0.1`
- **After**: `temperature=0`
- **Impact**: More deterministic, slightly faster responses

### 3. Add Response Limits (canvas_agent.py)
- **Added**: `max_tokens=500` - limits response length
- **Added**: `timeout=30` - prevents hanging requests
- **Impact**: Faster processing, better error handling

### 4. Reduce Max Iterations (canvas_agent.py)
- **Before**: `max_iterations=10`
- **After**: `max_iterations=5`
- **Impact**: Prevents excessive tool calls
- **Reasoning**: Most commands only need 1-2 iterations

### 5. Add Execution Timeout (canvas_agent.py)
- **Added**: `max_execution_time=30` seconds
- **Impact**: Entire agent execution must complete in 30s or timeout

### 6. Enable Early Stopping (canvas_agent.py)
- **Added**: `early_stopping_method="generate"`
- **Impact**: Agent stops as soon as it has a valid response
- **Prevents**: Unnecessary additional thinking/refinement steps

### 7. Keep Conversation Memory (canvas_agent.py)
- **Setting**: `k=6` (keeps last 6 conversation turns)
- **Decision**: Maintained at 6 to preserve good context for follow-up commands
- **Trade-off**: Slightly more context, but better conversation continuity

### 8. Optimize Response Prompt (prompts.py)
- **Added instructions**:
  - "BE EXTREMELY CONCISE"
  - "DO NOT explain your reasoning or process"
  - "Keep responses under 15 words when possible"
- **Impact**: Shorter responses = faster generation

## Expected Results

### Before Optimization
- **Average response time**: 10-15 seconds
- **Complex commands**: 30-60+ seconds
- **Cost per request**: ~$0.02-0.05

### After Optimization
- **Average response time**: 2-4 seconds âš¡
- **Complex commands**: 5-10 seconds
- **Cost per request**: ~$0.001-0.003 (15x cheaper)

## Testing

To verify the improvements:

1. **Simple command**: "create a red circle"
   - Expected: < 3 seconds

2. **Manipulation command**: "move the circle to the right"
   - Expected: < 5 seconds (includes get_canvas_shapes call)

3. **Complex command**: "create a login form"
   - Expected: < 8 seconds

## Deployment

These changes need to be deployed to production. After deployment:

1. Monitor response times in logs
2. Check that agent still performs correctly
3. Verify cost reduction in OpenAI dashboard

## Rollback Plan

If quality degrades, can quickly revert to GPT-4o by changing:
```python
model="gpt-4o"  # instead of gpt-4o-mini
temperature=0.1  # instead of 0
max_iterations=10  # instead of 5
```

## Notes

- GPT-4o-mini is highly capable for structured tasks like canvas manipulation
- The agent uses function calling, which works excellently with mini models
- Most commands only need 1 tool call, so 5 iterations is more than sufficient
- Conversation memory kept at 6 turns to maintain good context for follow-up commands
