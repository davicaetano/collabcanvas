4. Copy your Firebase configuration
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

## Current Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth login/logout
- **Canvas**: Smooth pan (drag) and zoom (scroll wheel) 
- **Shapes**: Click to create rectangles, drag to move
- **Real-time Sync**: All changes appear instantly for other users
- **Live Cursors**: See other users' mouse cursors with names
- **Presence**: View who's online with avatars
- **State Persistence**: Refresh browser, canvas state persists

### üöÄ Ready for Testing
The application is fully functional for the MVP requirements. You can:
1. Set up Firebase credentials
2. Test with multiple browser windows
3. Deploy to Vercel for public access

## Next Steps

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Firebase Setup**: Create Firebase project and add credentials to `.env`
2. **Vercel Deployment**: Push to GitHub and connect to Vercel
3. **Performance Testing**: Test with 5+ concurrent users
4. **Security Rules**: Apply the included `firestore.rules` to Firebase

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):
- Multiple shape types (circles, text)
- Shape resizing and rotation
- Color picker for shapes
- Undo/redo functionality
- Shape selection and multi-select
- Export/import canvas data
