═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK FIXES

IF CORS ERROR:
→ Check ALLOWED_ORIGINS in Render includes Vercel URL (exact match)
→ No trailing slashes in URLs
→ Restart backend after changes

IF AI COMMANDS DON'T WORK:
→ Check OpenAI API key is set in Render
→ Test backend health endpoint
→ Check browser console for errors
→ Verify VITE_AI_BACKEND_URL points to Render

IF SHAPES DON'T SYNC:
→ Check Firestore rules allow writes
→ Check Firebase authorized domains
→ Verify user is authenticated
→ Check browser console for Firestore errors

IF BACKEND IS SLOW (>5s):
→ Render free tier has cold starts (~15s)
→ Consider upgrading to paid tier
→ First request after inactivity will be slow
